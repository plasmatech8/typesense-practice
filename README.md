Following Typesense docs: https://typesense.org/docs/

> Typesense is an open-source, typo-tolerant search engine optimized for instant (typically sub-50ms) search-as-you-type experiences and developer productivity.

>    An open source alternative to Algolia, with some key quirks solved and

My impression is that Algolia is considered the open-source, comparatively cheap, relatively developer-friendly, modern alternative. It should be good. :)

It can be used for shop products, blogs, anything where items are added to your website that needs to be searchable.

Whenever a user creates a new item, a request to add a record must be sent to your seach engine database.
